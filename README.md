## Description

This project aimed to develop a tool that could assist players in the game by identifying in-game names using Optical Character Recognition (OCR) technology powered by Tesseract.

The purpose of this tool was to extract valuable information from the identified names, such as player stats, recent activity, twitch account, and other relevant data.

The ultimate goal of the project was to help players make better decisions and help identify possible cheaters by providing them with real-time information on their opponents.
